- Airbnb Style Guide compliant React Native App Utilizing
  [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite)

## :arrow_backward: Prerequisites

- [Node v12](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
- [React Native Dev
  Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/tree/master/packages/react-devtools)

## :arrow_up: Quick Start

```sh
# Ensure that you are using the correct version of Node
# If using nvm, run:
nvm use

# Install dependencies with `yarn`
yarn install

# Build and run for iOS
react-native run-ios

# Build and run for Android
react-native run-android

# Run standalone dev tools
react-devtools
```

## :arrow_forward: Advanced

Once the application is running, you can press '⌘D' in the simulator to open the debug menu. From
here, you can access:

- Remote JS Debugging
- Live reload
- Hot Reloading
- ... and more!

### iOS: Specifying a device

You can specify the device the simulator should run with the `--simulator` flag, followed by the
device name as a string. The default is `"iPhone 6"`. For exampel, if you wish to run your app on
an iPhone 4s, just run `react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 4s"`.

The device names correspond to the list of devices available in Xcode. You can check your available
devices by running `xcrun simctl list devices` from the console.

## :no_entry_sign: Airbnb Styleguide Compliant

This project adheres to Airbnb Styleguide Compliant. Our CI enforces this, so we suggest you enable
linting and auto-formatting to keep your project compliant during development.

## :closed_lock_with_key: Secrets

This project uses [react-native-config](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config) to expose
config variables to your javascript code in React Native. You can store API keys and other
sensitive information in a `.env` file:

```env
API_URL=https://myapi.com
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=abcdefgh
```

and access them from React Native like so:

```javascript
import Secrets from 'react-native-config'

Secrets.API_URL // 'https://myapi.com'
Secrets.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY // 'abcdefgh'
```

The `.env` file is ignored by git keeping those secrets out of your repo.

### Get started

1.  Copy .env.example to .env
2.  Add your config variables
3.  Follow instructions at
    [https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config#setup](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config#setup)
4.  Done!
